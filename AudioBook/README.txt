PDF TO AUDIO   (AUDIOBOOK)

Youâ€™ll need to install few libraries.
Pytssx3   	(pip install pytts3)
PyPDF2 	(pip install PyPDF2)
gtts         	(pip install gtts)

Run the program and a dialog box will appear. Just select the .pdf file you want to convert to audio. PRESS 1 if you want to hear the converted pdf at that moment (and saved afterwards). Otherwise it will be saved automatically.
The .mp3 file will be saved in the same directory.
